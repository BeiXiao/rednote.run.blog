## When Will TikTok Be Banned?

According to the law, if ByteDance does not sell TikTok by Sunday, January 19, 2025, TikTok will be banned in the United States starting that day. This doesn't mean TikTok will disappear from your device if it's already downloaded before January 19. However, you won't be able to find TikTok in the app store or update it after that date.

## How Do I Delete All My Videos on TikTok at Once?

Now, let's talk about managing your TikTok content. Unfortunately, TikTok does not currently offer an option to delete all your videos at once, so you'll need to delete them manually, one by one. Here's the guide:

1. Go to your profile and click the video you want to delete
2. Access the Options Menu by clicking the three dots (…) on the right side of the screen
3. Scroll to find the Delete option, click it, and your video will be deleted

### Alternative: Deactivate Your Account

1. Go to your profile
2. Tap the menu (☰) button at the top
3. Tap Settings and Privacy
4. Tap Account, then select Deactivate or delete the account, and follow the instructions
